# MLflow Experiment Project

This project demonstrates how MLflow can be used to track and compare machine learning experiments.

The goal is to understand how experiment tracking helps data teams:
- compare multiple model runs
- store metrics and parameters
- reproduce results reliably
- avoid manual experiment tracking

This mirrors how ML models are evaluated in real-world data science workflows.

## Tools Used
- Python
- MLflow
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas

## How to Run

1. Install requirements
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Open the notebook
   project.ipynb

3. Run all cells

4. Start MLflow
   mlflow ui

## What I Learned
- Tracking experiments
- Comparing models
- Saving ML models
